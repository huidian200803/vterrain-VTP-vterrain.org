	<p>The VTP Content Manager (<b>CManager</b>) is a useful tool for organizing, 
	categorizing, and preparing your 3d models for use with the VTP software environment.</p>
	<h3>Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Load and view your models interactively to see how they will look in 
		the virtual world.</li>
		<li>Organize multiple models representing levels of detail of the same object 
		into a single conception &#39;Item&#39;.</li>
		<li>Classify your items with high-level attributes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How to Use</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Put your models anywhere you like on your Data path.&nbsp; Here are 
		some recommended locations:
		<ul>
			<li>Buildings: <code>Data/BuildingModels</code></li>
			<li>Plants: <code>Data/PlantModels</code></li>
			<li>Vehicles: <code>Data/Vehicles</code></li>
			<li>all other culture: <code>Data/Culture</code></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Run CManager</li>
		<li>Create an Item for each object you have modelled.</li>
		<li>Give each Item a name (e.g. &quot;1975 Ford Bronco&quot;) and a type (e.g. &quot;sports 
		utility vehicle&quot;).&nbsp; You can optionally add any other attributes that 
		you want, here, by adding Tags.</li>
		<li>To each Item, add a Model.&nbsp; You can either use &quot;Add Model&quot; and 
		browse to your file, or drag-and-drop files from the Windows Explorer.&nbsp; 
		If the Models were created with units other than meters, you can set the 
		scale factor for each one.</li>
		<li>If you have several levels of detail, add more Models to the Item and 
		set the &quot;Visible at distance&quot; field for each Model.&nbsp; This is the farthest 
		distance at which the model is visible.&nbsp; If you only have a single 
		model, you can leave this distance at &quot;0&quot;.&nbsp; You should add your models 
		in order from most detailed to least detailed.</li>
		<li>When you have added all your Items, save the Content file (.vtco file 
		extension)</li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<p>If you need more control over your content than CManager gives you, you 
		can also simply edit your Content file by hand, as it is a simple XML format.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Camera Control</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Left Mouse Button: Orbit around model (pitch/yaw)</li>
		<li>Right Mouse Button: Pan camera</li>
		<li>Both Mouse Buttons, drag up/down: Zoom in/out</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>CManager is &quot;in beta&quot; and the documentation is still very small.<br />
		However, you may find most features to be self-explanatory.<br />
		<b>Please</b> email any questions you may have to
		<a href="mailto:ben@vterrain.org">myself</a>&nbsp; or the
		<a href="http://vterrain.org/Site/contact.html">mailing list</a>.</p>
