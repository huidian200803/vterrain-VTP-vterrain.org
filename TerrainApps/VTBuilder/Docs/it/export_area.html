<h2>Strumento Area<br />
</h2>
Questo strumento vi permette di indicare un &#39;area rettangolare d&#39;interesse. E&#39; utile 
per indicare dove tu vuoi operare altri livelli, per elevazione, immagini, e la 
vegetazione.

<h3>Toolbar:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Area Tool (<img src="images/tb_area.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="37" width="39" />) 
	can be used to set the desired area directly with the mouse.&nbsp; Click on 
	any edge of the area tool to move that edge, or click inside to move the whole 
	area without resizing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Merge and Resample Elevation Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>You can choose where the output will go: To a new layer (in memory), To a 
	file, or To a tileset (folder of tiles).</p>
	<p>This dialog displays:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
		<li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking 
		at the X spacing of the first elevation layer.</li>
		<li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size 
		of a grid that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample 
		factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density (spacing), 
		this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Output to a new layer or to a file:</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp; 
		Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the 
		&quot;<b>X size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
		<p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2 + 1</b>&quot; constraint you 
		can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by Terrain LOD, 
		which is highly desirable at visualization runtime.</p>
		<p>For effective visualization it is recommended that you pick a output 
		size that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits 
		of your computer&#39;s RAM.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Output to a folder of tiles (Tileset):</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This option has no limit on the size of the data.&nbsp; Press <i>Tile 
		Options</i> for the <b>Tiling Options</b> dialog.&nbsp; Give the output 
		a filename, and set the number of rows and columns of the tile grid along 
		with the tile size (LOD0 Size) which gives the highest resolution of each 
		tile.&nbsp; The <b>Information</b> display helps you see whether your tiling 
		is a good approximation of the input data your are resampling.&nbsp; For 
		smoother visualization, is it good to keep the tile grid size large and 
		the LOD0 Size small (512 or less) so that there are shorter pauses as each 
		tile is paged.&nbsp; Alternately, if smoothness isn&#39;t a concern, you can 
		decrease the tile grid size, and increase the LOD0 Size, which will result 
		in a drastically smaller number of files on your disk.</p>
		<p>See <a href="../Enviro/tilesets.html">Enviro: Tilesets</a> for a description 
		of how tilesets are handled at runtime.&nbsp; If you are using a tileset 
		for your elevation, you must have a tileset of the same grid size for the 
		imagery.</p>

<h3>Merge and Resample Imagery Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>You can choose where the output will go: To a new layer (in memory), To a 
	file, or To a tileset (folder of tiles).</p>
	<p>This dialog displays:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
		<li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking 
		at the X spacing of the first imagery layer.</li>
		<li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size 
		of a grid that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample 
		factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density (spacing), 
		this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>

<h3>Match Area<b> and Tiling to Layer</b> Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>This is useful when you will be tiling your terrain, and you want to sample 
	your data at its exact, full resolution.&nbsp; For example, if you have some 
	elevation data with 10m spacing or aerial photos with 1m spacing, you will probably 
	want your tile resolution to match this exactly, so that you are seeing your 
	full original data without any sampling artifacts.</p>
	<p>Set the area you are interested in, with the Area Tool, then give this command.&nbsp; 
	You should see the dialog <b>Match Area and Tiling to Layer.</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><i>Previous:</i> </b>This is your original area of interest, which 
		we will try to match.</li>
		<li><b><i>Current: </i></b>This is the current tiled area, as close as possible 
		to the original area.</li>
		<li><b><i>Match Layer: </i></b>This is the layer you want to match.&nbsp; 
		For example, if you have one layers at 2m and some others at 4m, you might 
		want to tell the dialog to match the 2m layer.</li>
		<li><b><i>Layer Resolution: </i></b>This shows you the resolution (X and 
		Y spacing) of the selected layer.</li>
		<li><i><b>Allow Area to Grow/Shrink:</b>&nbsp; </i>In case your desired 
		area can&#39;t be matched exactly with tiling, the area will need to grow or 
		shrink.&nbsp; You can indicate which is allowable.&nbsp; For example, if 
		you are sampling elevation, you will probably not want to grow the area 
		outside the bounds of your original area, because then you would be sampling 
		from an area with no elevation, which is undesirable.</li>
		<li><b><i>Tile LOD0 Size: </i></b>This is value you set.&nbsp; Tiles have 
		a number of levels of detail (LOD), which are numbered starting from 0.&nbsp; 
		Hence, the LOD0 size is the highest resolution of each tile, which is value 
		we want to match to the input data.&nbsp; For efficient paging at runtime, 
		you should try to keep this value small (512 for elevation, 1024 for imagery).&nbsp; 
		You can make it smaller, for even smoother paging at the expense of more 
		tile files.</li>
		<li><b><i>Tiling: </i></b>This is the tiling that results from matching 
		your desired resolution and area.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The tiling (area and number of tiles) is also shown visually in the main 
	view.</p>
