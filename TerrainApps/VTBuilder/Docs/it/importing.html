<h3>Importing Data into VTBuilder</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>There are two ways to import data files: with the &quot;Layer: Import&quot; command, 
	or by using drag-and-drop to drag files into the VTBuilder window.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Layer: Import</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>With the Layer: Import command, you will be asked for the kind of data to 
	expect: Elevation, Imagery, and so forth.&nbsp; This is important because many 
	file formats can be interpreted in more than one way.&nbsp; For example, a Shapefile 
	(.shp) can be used to represent Water, Road, or Building features.&nbsp; Since 
	Shapefiles lack any kind of standards for attributes, a computer can't guess 
	what sort of data it really is, unless it knows what to expect.&nbsp; For another 
	example, TIF files can be interpreted as either Imagery or Elevation, so telling 
	VTBuilder makes it clear how to handle your TIF file.</p>
	<p>Depending on the layer type, VTBuilder may give you additional dialogs to 
	clarify how to import the data.&nbsp; See the documentation for each layer type 
	(e.g. <a href="buildings.html">Structure Layers</a>) for an explanation of the 
	issues involved in importing data of that type.&nbsp; If the data lacks a
	<a href="projdlg.html">CRS</a>, then you may be shown the
	<a href="projdlg.html">Projection Dialog</a> to specify it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Drag-and-Drop</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>The fastest and easiest way to import files is to drag-and-drop them from 
	your operating system file manager.&nbsp; Multiple files can be imported at 
	once by dragging over a group of icons.&nbsp; This is really useful when you 
	have a whole directory full of small files which need to be imported and merged.</p>
	<p>When you drop files, VTBuilder won't ask you the layer type for each file, 
	but instead will do its best to guess.&nbsp; Un-guessable GIS files like .shp 
	will be imported as Raw layers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Compressed File Support (.gz, .tar.gz, and .zip)</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>If you drag-and-drop a compressed (archive) file, VTBuilder will quietly 
	unarchive it to a temporary folder, and look in that folder for something to 
	import.&nbsp; If the archive contains a single file, it will act as if you dropped 
	in that file by itself.&nbsp; If the archive contains multiple files, it will 
	look for distinctive patterns like &quot;catd.ddf&quot; and &quot;.dem&quot; to try figure out what 
	to import.</p>
	<p>The feature is very convenient for the user, especially for awkward formats 
	like SDTS.</p>
	<p>If you encounter a situation where a file is not importing as expected, please 
	let us know.</p>
