<title>Using Your Own Imagery</title>

<h1><i>Enviro</i></h1>
<h2>Using Your Own Imagery (Textures)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your image needs to match your elevation in both projection and extents.&nbsp; 
	One way to do this is to use VTBuilder to re-project and crop your elevation, 
	as needed, to match your image.</li>
	<li>If your image is up to 4096*4096 in size (or 8192x8192 for recent 3D hardware), 
	you can use a standard terrain texture.&nbsp; If it is much larger, you should 
	use an <a href="tilesets.html">image tileset</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Standard Terrain Textures</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Your imagery should be in either the TIF, PNG, BMP or JPG format.</li>
	<li>Learn how large a texture your computer can display.&nbsp; From the Enviro 
	Start dialog, press &quot;OpenGL Info...&quot; and look at the number for &quot;Maximum 
	Texture Dimension&quot;</li>
	<li>If your terrain texture map is not larger than the maximum texture, you 
	can use the &quot;Single texture&quot; option, otherwise you will need to use &quot;4x4 
	Tiled texture&quot;.</li>
	<li>Give your texture a filename ending in it&#39;s size, e.g. &quot;<code>newyork_1024.bmp</code>&quot;</li>
	<li>Put your texture in in the directory<code> Data/GeoSpecific</code></li>
	<li>For a Single texture:
	<ul>
		<li>Your texture size must be a square power of 2, up to the limit of your 
		computer (e.g. 512, 1024)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For a 4x4 Tiled texture:
	<ul>
		<li>You provide a single large square image file, and Enviro will break 
		it up for you, at runtime, into a set of 16 tiles (4x4)</li>
		<li>The size of each tile must be a power of 2, up to the limit of your 
		computer (e.g. 512, 1024)</li>
		<li>Due to pixel overlap to avoid texture seams, the dimensions of the single 
		large texture may seem somewhat unusual - e.g. 2045 for a 4x4 at 512, 4093 
		for a 4x4 at 1024</li>
		<li>The filename is made up of two parts: the prefix (e.g. &quot;hawaii_&quot;) 
		and the image size (e.g. &quot;4093&quot;). The dialog lets you specify 
		the prefix, and it computes and appends the image size, based on the tile 
		size you specify</li>
		<li>So, when you&#39;re preparing your image files, simply name them ending 
		in a number that is their size in pixels (e.g. &quot;hawaii_4093.bmp&quot;)</li>
		<li>Click the &quot;JPEG&quot; box for a jpeg texture, otherwise BMP is 
		assumed.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If you provide an image which has an alpha plane (transparency), Enviro 
	will use it.</li>
	<li>Provide a PNG or TIF that is 32-bit, that is, 24 bits of RGB and 8 bits 
	of Alpha.</li>
	<li>You may see some odd effects if you have <strong>other</strong> transparent 
	objects in the scene, above or below the terrain surface.&nbsp; This is because 
	OSG/OpenGL cannot always sort transparent objects relative to each other perfectly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the base texture for a terrain, if you have a modern graphics card 
with multi-texture, you can use <a href="images.html">Image Layers</a> to overlay 
additional textures on your terrain.</p>
